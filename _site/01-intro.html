<p>Cloud computing is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts_Schematics/cloud-computing-gears.jpg" alt="image-title-here" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>DigitalOcean calls its virtual private servers Droplets; each Droplet that you sign up is a new VPS for your personal use.</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: -12px;text-decoration: underline;">  About Virtual Private Server</h3>
<p>A virtual private server (VPS) is a virtual machine sold as a service by an Internet hosting service. A VPS runs its own copy of an operating system, and customers have superuser-level access to that operating system instance, so they can install almost any software that runs on that OS.</p>

<p>Note. You will be receiving email notifications from Digital Ocean.</p>

<p>NB. The First email notification you will receive it is going to be your account credentials for that specific (<em>droplet</em>) you’ve just created.</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: -12px;">continuation ...  </h3>

<h1 id="how-to-create-your-first-digitalocean-droplet-virtual-server">How To Create Your First DigitalOcean Droplet Virtual Server</h1>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: -12px;">Step One — Signed in and you want to Create Droplet</h3>
<p><img src="/img/posts_Schematics/welcomepagetocreatedroplet.png" alt="image-title-here" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>01.To create your first Droplet go to the DigitalOcean Control Panel and log in with your email and password. The create button will be right there on the first page: click on "Create Droplet".</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 style="font-weight: bold;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: -12px;"> Step Two — Select Droplet Image </h3>
<p>You can create your Droplet image from 4 possible categories</p>

<ul>
  <li>02.<code class="highlighter-rouge">As a begginer we would recommended you to chose UBUNTU image ["CLOUD SERVER OPERATING SYSTEM"] and at this stage you should at least know how UBUNTU TERMINAL WORKS just for the future purpose which is when you are done creating your droplet.</code></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/img/posts_Schematics/osimages.png" alt="image-title-here" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: -12px;text-decoration: underline;"> Distributions </h3>
<p>Create from several operating systems, such as Ubuntu, Debian, CoreOS, and CentOS. After selecting your distribution, be sure to select the image of your choice (specifying the version and 64 bit or 32 bit).</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: -12px;text-decoration: underline;"> One-click Apps </h3>
<p>Create from images that have pre-installed and configured programs that will get your Droplet off to a strong start.</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: -12px;text-decoration: underline;"> Snapshots: </h3>
<p>Create from a snapshot that you previously made, letting you create backup copies or scale quickly.</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: -12px;text-decoration: underline;"> Backups </h3>
<p>Create from a previously automatically generated backup, the option that you can enable on each Droplet individually with the "Backups" button.</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: -12px;text-decoration: underline;"> 32-bit vs. 64-bit Systems </h3>
<p>A 32-bit operating system is recommended for cloud servers with less than 3 GB of RAM -- this is especially true for servers with 1 GB, or less, of RAM. Processes can require significantly more memory on the 64-bit architecture. On servers with a limited amount of RAM, any performance benefits that one might gain from a 64-bit operating system would be diluted by having less memory available for buffers and caching.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 style="font-weight: bold;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: -12px;">Step Three-Select Your Droplet's Size depending on your needs and budget, you can select the Droplet option that works best for you.</h3>

<p>03.You should chose the cheapest image with less space which is going to be 20GB and each project isn’t going to even exceed 100MegaBytes, otherwise you can upgrade your droplet. You could get your droplet up and running again without losing your stuff hence all files are safe only when a backup is created.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts_Schematics/imagesizes.png" alt="image-title-here" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>There is a wide spectrum for prices, power, and storage capacity. The smallest and least expensive option starts at 512MB of RAM with 1 CPU and 20GB of SSD storage. The size options grow larger from there, all the way up to 64GB of RAM with 20 CPUs and 640GB of SSD storage. Should your needs change at a future point, you can adjust your Droplet's plan using the flexible and permanent resize options.</p>
