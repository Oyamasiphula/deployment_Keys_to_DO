#  Lets introduce the default firewall configuration tool for Ubuntu

`UFW`, or `Uncomplicated Firewall`, is an interface to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000//glossary/iptables.html">iptables</a> that is geared towards simplifying the process of configuring a firewall. While iptables is a solid and flexible tool, it can be difficult for beginners to learn how to use it to properly configure a firewall. If you're looking to get started securing your network, and you're not sure which tool to use, UFW may be the right choice for you.
