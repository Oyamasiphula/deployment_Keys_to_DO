# Introduction
DigitalOcean calls its virtual private servers Droplets; each Droplet that you sign up is a new VPS for your personal use.
 About Virtual Private Server
A virtual private server (VPS) is a virtual machine sold as a service by an Internet hosting service. A VPS runs its own copy of an operating system, and customers have superuser-level access to that operating system instance, so they can install almost any software that runs on that OS.

# How To Create Your First DigitalOcean Droplet Virtual Server

# Step One — Log In
![image-title-here](/img/posts_Schematics/createdSuccesfully.png){:class="img-responsive"}

To create your first Droplet go to the DigitalOcean Control Panel and log in with your email and password. The create button will be right there on the first page: click on "Create Droplet".


<h3> Step Two — Select Droplet Image </h3><p>You can create your Droplet image from 4 possible categories:

<h3> Distributions: </h3><p>Create from several operating systems, such as Ubuntu, Debian, CoreOS, and CentOS. After selecting your distribution, be sure to select the image of your choice (specifying the version and 64 bit or 32 bit).</p>


<h3> One-click Apps: </h3><p>
Create from images that have pre-installed and configured programs that will get your Droplet off to a strong start.</p>


<h3> Snapshots: </h3><p>
Create from a snapshot that you previously made, letting you create backup copies or scale quickly.</p>


<h3> Backups: </h3><p>
Create from a previously automatically generated backup, the option that you can enable on each Droplet individually with the "Backups" button.</p>


<h3> 32-bit vs. 64-bit Systems </h3><p>A 32-bit operating system is recommended for cloud servers with less than 3 GB of RAM -- this is especially true for servers with 1 GB, or less, of RAM. Processes can require significantly more memory on the 64-bit architecture. On servers with a limited amount of RAM, any performance benefits that one might gain from a 64-bit operating system would be diluted by having less memory available for buffers and caching.
